# API and settings

## YAML structure

YAML isn’t everyone’s favorite markup language, but it has the advantage of being very lean, mapping well to both JSON and Python data structures, and supporting comments.

Here is what you need to know:

- Always use `.yaml` for patterns configuration.
- Use Mappings in place of Python Dictionaries.
- Use Sequences in place of Python lists (or iterables like QuerySets).
- The pattern library uses [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation) in particular

Here is an example in practice:

```yaml
name: Test
# Nested structure, dependent on template.
context:
  quote: What is love?
  attribution: Haddaway
  my_list:
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
# Mapping from tag names to tag overrides.
tags:
  error_tag:
    include:
      template_name: 'non-patterns/include.html'
```

## Templates

### `pattern_library_rendered_pattern`

`pattern_library_rendered_pattern` is required in the template defined as [`PATTERN_BASE_TEMPLATE_NAME`](#pattern_base_template_name). This gets replaced by the rendered pattern’s HTML when displaying patterns in the library.

```django
<body>
  {% block content %}{{ pattern_library_rendered_pattern }}{% endblock %}
</body>
```

## Settings

See [Getting started](../getting-started.md) for more guided information.

### `PATTERN_LIBRARY`

All settings should be set as keys of the `PATTERN_LIBRARY` object.

```python
PATTERN_LIBRARY = {
    # […]
}
```

### `SECTIONS`

`SECTIONS` controls the groups of templates that appear in the navigation.
The keys are the group titles and the values are lists of template name prefixes that will be searched to populate the groups.

You can use this to create basic two-folder "includes and pages" hierarchies:

```python
PATTERN_LIBRARY = {
    "SECTIONS": (
        ("components", ["patterns/components"]),
        ("pages", ["patterns/pages"]),
    ),
}
```

Or more detailed structures following [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/):

```python
PATTERN_LIBRARY = {
    "SECTIONS": (
        ("atoms", ["patterns/atoms"]),
        ("molecules", ["patterns/molecules"]),
        ("organisms", ["patterns/organisms"]),
        ("templates", ["patterns/templates"]),
        ("pages", ["patterns/pages"]),
    ),
}
```

### `TEMPLATE_SUFFIX`

Defaults to `.html`. Only set this if your templates use another file extension.

```python
PATTERN_LIBRARY = {
    "TEMPLATE_SUFFIX": ".dj",
}
```

### `PATTERN_BASE_TEMPLATE_NAME`

`PATTERN_BASE_TEMPLATE_NAME` is the template that fragments will be wrapped with.
It should include any required CSS and JS, and output [`pattern_library_rendered_pattern`](#pattern_library_rendered_pattern) from context.

```python
PATTERN_LIBRARY = {
    "PATTERN_BASE_TEMPLATE_NAME": "patterns/base.html",
}
```

### `BASE_TEMPLATE_NAMES`

Any template in `BASE_TEMPLATE_NAMES` or any template that extends a template in `BASE_TEMPLATE_NAMES` is a "page" and will be rendered as-is without being wrapped.

```python
PATTERN_LIBRARY = {
    "BASE_TEMPLATE_NAMES": ["patterns/base_page.html"],
}
```

## Commands

### `render_patterns`

Renders all django-pattern-library patterns to HTML files, in a directory
structure. This can be useful for [automated tests](../guides/automated-tests.md)

Usage:

```sh
# Render all patterns to the default directory.
./manage.py render_patterns
# Render patterns without outputting files.
./manage.py render_patterns --dry-run
# Render all patterns, with fragment patterns wrapped in the base template.
./manage.py render_patterns --wrap-fragments
# Render patterns to a specific directory.
./manage.py render_patterns --output ./my/path/relative/to/cwd
# Render patterns to stdout.
./manage.py render_patterns --dry-run --verbosity 2
# View all options
./manage.py render_patterns --help
```
