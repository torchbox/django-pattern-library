# Help and support

If you need help with this project, here are things you should try.

## Documentation search

We take good care to document common use cases of the library, with examples and code snippets. We also document use cases that are known to not be well supported, with links to issues.

## GitHub search

GitHub’s [main search](https://github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library/search?q=help) can find matches in existing issues, pull requests, and discussions. The [cs.github.com code search](https://cs.github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library?q=help) is excellent to search within the repository.

## GitHub Discussions

No luck with the existing documentation and other search results? Open a new discussion in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library/discussions) for conversations relating to the project. This can be used for support requests, or high-level feature ideas that don’t fit well with our issue template.
